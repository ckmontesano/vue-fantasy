# Montesano Fantasy Baseball

## Overview

Vue 3 site for the Montesano Fantasy Baseball league, updated for the 2026 season. The app now uses live MLB StatsAPI data at runtime with client-side caching in `localStorage` to keep calls low.

## Agent Start Here

- Agent operating notes: `AGENTS.md`
- League rules context: `docs/league-context.md`
- Efficient API workflows and examples: `docs/agent-workflows.md`
- MLB StatsAPI schema snapshot: `docs/api/swagger-docs.json`

## 2025 -> 2026 Rule Changes

- Wagers are collected up front on draft day instead of settling balances month by month.
- Regular-season team points are now calculated from true draft-day division odds, including negative odds.
- Draft value is prorated by round. Round 1 keeps full value, and rounds 2-7 step down by sevenths.
- Wild-card teams are now worth points, but only at end of season.
- Special-case bonuses such as no-hitters or player record events are gone.
- Tie-breakers now follow MLB-style tie-break ordering instead of point sharing inside divisions.

## Runtime Data

- MLB standings are fetched live from StatsAPI and cached in `localStorage` for one hour.
- All-Star data is fetched live when available and cached in `localStorage` for twelve hours.
- 2026 draft ownership, odds, rounds, and stakes live in `src/data/season-2026.js`.
- Historical payout results are kept in `src/data/payout-history.js`.
- Team logos live in `src/assets/team-logos/`.
- Home Run Derby image lives in `src/assets/hrd-2025.jpg`.
